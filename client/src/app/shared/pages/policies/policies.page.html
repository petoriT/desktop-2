<h2>
  Our Becoming
</h2>
<ion-text>
  The inception of AfroB Pty Limited has always been driven by the passionate desire for homegrown application code to serve the unique online needs of many local startup enterprises. We also appreciate that without consumers our ecosystem is incomplete, but more than just curating for consumers, we take pleasure in creating a tailored shopping experience for ourselves and those who appreciate a lifestyle shopping convenience that encourages online shopping in one beautiful experience. Our team comprises of talented business process analysts, backend and front-end developers. We are inspired by the challenges faced by Africans seeking an end-to-end solution that serves as a catalyst to leverage client relationships and improve online revenue.

<h2>
  Long term objectives
</h2>
<ion-text>
  We are an online B2C and B2B service provider that aims to catapult start-up businesses the best way we can without frustrating our customers' ambition in trying to persuade them of our services.

Though we press on towards our business goals we would not realise our vision until our innovations spread throughout the African continent.

          you use their services—whether or not you have a Cartalist account or are logged into Cartalist
          software. For example, a vendor store developer could use our API to tell us what software you
          are interested in buying, or a business could tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We
          also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data
